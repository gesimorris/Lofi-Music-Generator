# Lofi-Music-Generator
An experimental AI project that generates lo-fi music based on the emotional tone or "vibe" of an input image. Uses neural networks, simulated annealing, and Fourier analysis to interpret visual input and translate it into ambient sound. A creative fusion of image-based emotion recognition and generative music.
